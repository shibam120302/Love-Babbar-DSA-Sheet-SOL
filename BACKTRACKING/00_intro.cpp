    Backtracking Algorithm:
    Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying
    to build a solution incrementally. Solving one piece at a time, and removing those solutions
    that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here,
    is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree) is the process of backtracking.
